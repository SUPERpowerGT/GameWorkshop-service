# Global rule: All text files use LF line endings (consistent across Linux/Mac/Windows)
# Git will NOT convert LF to CRLF when pulling files to local
* text eol=lf

# Maven Wrapper script (for Linux/Mac) - MUST use LF to ensure executable on Unix-like systems
/mvnw text eol=lf

# Windows batch files - MUST use CRLF (required for proper execution on Windows)
*.cmd text eol=crlf
*.bat text eol=crlf

# Binary files (images, archives, executables) - treat as binary to avoid corruption
# Git won't process line endings or generate text-based diffs for these
